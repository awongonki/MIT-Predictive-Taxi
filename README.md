**Project Predictive Analytics: New York City Taxi Ride Duration Prediction**

New York City taxi rides form the core of the traffic in the city of New York. <br>
The many rides taken every day by New Yorkers in the busy city can give us a great idea of traffic times, road blockages, and so on. 
A typical taxi company faces a common problem of efficiently assigning the cabs to passengers so that the service is hassle-free. <br>
One of the main issues is predicting the duration of the current ride so it can predict when the cab will be free for the next trip. 
The data set contains various information regarding the taxi trips, its duration in New York City. 
We will apply different techniques, including feature engineering to get insights into the data and determine how different variables are dependent on the Trip Duration.
